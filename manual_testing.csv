(The Sports Xchange) - The Boston Red Sox fired manager John Farrell on Wednesday, two days after his team was eliminated from the playoffs.
Farrell, who managed the Red Sox since 2013, will not return for the 2018 season, president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski announcement. The team said a search for a new manager will begin immediately.
Farrell, 55, was 432-378 (.533) in five seasons, leading the Red Sox to the World Series title in 2013. He was under contract through the end of the 2018 season.
The Red Sox were eliminated from the playoffs on Monday, losing to the Houston Astros 5-4 in Game 4 of the American League Division Series.
Boston finished 93-69 (.574) in 2017 to win its ninth AL East division title. The Red Sox had the third-best record in the American League, tied for fifth best in the majors.
During his Red Sox tenure, Farrell’s teams won three division titles (2013, 2016, 2017). His 432 managerial wins and 810 games managed both rank sixth in club history, and he is the only manager ever to lead the Red Sox to consecutive division titles.
Farrell’s first season in 2013 was highlighted by Boston’s eighth World Series championship.
Farrell began his major league managerial career with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011, leading the team to a 154-170 record over two seasons. In his seven full seasons as a manager, his clubs went 586-548 (.517).
Farrell’s first professional coaching stint began with Boston in 2007 when he spent four seasons as pitching coach. Over that four-year span, the Red Sox had three postseason appearances (2007-09), including the 2007 World Series title.",1

",35 False Matches and 1 Erroneous Arrest As Police Secretly Test Facial Recognition Technology,"By Nicholas West
All things biometric are sweeping across the world at warp speed now, from security on planes and trains to check-ins at conferences and events, banking systems, etc. But the use of facial recognition tech in policing is being touted as the next big thing to keep the public safe. In fact, facial recognition technology is already working on the next level of development with researchers constructing new algorithms that supposedly can penetrate the most simple method of avoidance: wearing a mask.
However, a recent event in Britain should cause those who are high on this technology to rein in their enthusiasm. According to a Sky News report, a recent carnival in Notting Hill was treated as a testing ground for police facial recognition systems. The results were troubling.
The controversial trial of facial recognition equipment at Notting Hill Carnival resulted in roughly 35 false matches and an ‘erroneous arrest’ … The system only produced a single accurate match during the course of Carnival, but the individual had already been processed by the justice system between the time police compiled the suspect database and deployed it.
Firstly, the fact that the general public were used as guinea pigs by the police state when they were there to enjoy a celebratory event shows the level of disdain for basic civil liberties. Secondly, the fact that a test should result in actual questioning and detentions only doubles down on the violations to personal freedom. Lastly, one might wonder how any matches were made to begin with. Sky News reveals what we in the U.S. also have come to learn – the government has built a secret database (including innocent people) that’s just been waiting for the implementation of the recognition systems.
In the days before Carnival, Sky News revealed that police have more than 20 million facial recognition images on the British public, including hundreds of thousands on innocent people. There are a number of legal questions surrounding the police’s databases, especially following a High Court ruling in 2012 which said that the retention of those images was unlawful.
That ruling seems to matter little to the Metropolitan Police who clearly suggest that such trials will continue:
The Met said: “We have always maintained that it was a continued trial to test the technology and assess if it could assist police in identifying known offenders in large events, in order to protect the wider public.” “A full analysis of its deployments and a wider consultation will take place at the conclusion of the trial,” the spokesperson added, although no date was given for this. The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) Sky sources have suggested that the Met is planning to trial the technology at other events in the future.
This is the type of lawlessness that has now taken over law enforcement in an age where the public is just expected to endure a full loss of liberty in the name of security.

","Hervé Leroux, Creator of the Hervé Léger Bandage Dress, Dies at 60","Mr. Leroux was born Hervé Peugnet on May 30, 1957, in Bapaume, in northern France. He studied sculpture and art history at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris before dropping out to become a hairstylist and milliner.

In 1981 he met Karl Lagerfeld, who encouraged him to pursue fashion design. He changed his surname for the first time after Mr. Lagerfeld advised him that Peugnet would be too difficult for Americans, the target market, to pronounce. He suggested Léger, liking the allusion to lightness, for which the French word is légèreté.
Mr. Leroux, now working under the name Léger, worked alongside Mr. Lagerfeld at Fendi and later at Chanel and freelanced at Lanvin and Diane von Furstenberg before introducing his own boutique, Hervé Léger, in 1984. A fashion line with the new name soon followed, and then came the inception of the bandage dress.
“The story of the dress is a very simple one,” Mr. Leroux said. “Before I started making clothes, I was a hairdresser, then a hat maker. One day in a factory I found some bands that were headed for the garbage. They gave me the idea of taking those bands and putting them next to one another as one does making a hat.”

Coinciding with the ascendance of Azzedine Alaïa, the so-called King of Cling, Mr. Leroux’s bandage dress received considerable acclaim. It was designed to encase a figure and enhance it in the most flattering of ways. While sales never reached blockbuster levels, the dress’s aesthetic impact would be seen in the work of rivals on runways and on the clothes racks of mass-market retailers.
“Mr. Léger proved why Paris is the center of fashion creativity,” Carrie Donovan wrote in The New York Times Magazine after a show in 1991, using the surname he went by at the time. “His collection was original, well thought out, knowledgeably executed and about as incendiary as style can be these days.”
His designs also proved alluring to investors keen to expand the company across product lines and geographical borders. In 1998, Mr. Leroux’s business was acquired by the Los Angeles-based group BCBG Max Azria. It was the first time an American company had acquired a French designer-couturier.
But he quickly fell out with the new owners, and in 1999 he lost control of the Léger name, which was retained by Mr. Azria, who called the new collection “Hervé Léger by Max Azria.”
In 2000, Mr. Léger founded his own independently financed fashion house, Herve L. Leroux, adopting a new surname that had again been suggested by his old friend and mentor Mr. Lagerfeld.

As Mr. Leroux recalled in an interview with Style.com in 2006, “He told me, ‘Call yourself Leroux because your hair is red — not as red as it was, because you are older — but, anyway, it works, and everyone will know who you are.’”

In the last chapter of his career, Mr. Leroux’s clientele remained loyal to his feminine jersey dresses and his chic approach to contemporary cocktail attire. As creative director of the Paris house Guy LaRoche from 2004 to 2006, he dressed Hilary Swank for the 2005 Academy Awards ceremony in a memorable backless midnight-blue jersey gown, which was seen by millions of television viewers when she strode to the stage to accept the best actress award for her performance in the movie “Million Dollar Baby.”
Mr. Leroux showed a new collection in 2013 as a guest on the Paris couture calendar after a 12-year hiatus from the catwalk. But he never again achieved the recognition or fame he found under his previous name, underscoring the creative and commercial struggles that can ensue when a designer’s name is no longer the designer’s.
He is survived by his sister, Jocelyne, who was a partner in the Leroux business.
After the news of his death broke, many of those who loved his designs shared tributes on Instagram.
The entertainer Dita Von Teese wrote: “We’ve lost one of the fashion greats. I loved Hervé for his wit, his candor, his sublime elegance and of course, his talent, which came from authentic obsession, with no care for the commerciality of fashion.”
And Cindy Crawford, posting a picture of herself standing next to Mr. Leroux in one of his scarlet red creations, wrote, “Remembering the man who created the bandage dress, which held you in all the right places.”

One win doesn’t change the fact that the team is still rebuilding and trying to build a young core going forward. But through the first three games there are some trends that bear watching:
– The offensive staff has shown an ability to adjust on the fly to get the offense stabilized. Whether it’s been using 6-7 OLinemen to establish the run or TE & FB to chip pass rushers.
– The OLine (all 28 and under) has been very good in pass protection and improving in run blocking. And the fact that the staff has mixed and matched them in various aliments shows we may actually have depth.
– The TE position could actually be a big time strength with Seferian-Jenkins, Tye and Leggett (once healthy). The inline blocking of the position has surprised me.
– The acquisition of Kearse the continued development of Anderson and the flashes Stewart show give me hope for a nice corps of WR. But the staff MUST use Stewart & Hansen more, if we have those four and a healthy Enunwa next year we may have something.
– Forte looks slower than last year, Powell and McGuire need to be the primary RB’s going forward.
– Will the defense continue to stay true to their assignments? They absolutely detroyed MIA who has a lot of weapons and a good OLine just by doing their jobs. Can they keep it up? Because it’s amazing how good our ILB’s looked once everyone maintained their gaps and tackled. It’s also crucial because a sound defense allows Adams to be used all over the field as highlighted in Cimini’s article.

",China to accept overseas trial data in bid to speed up drug approvals,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China said it plans to accept data from overseas clinical trials to speed up approvals of drugs, a potential boon for international drugmakers as well as patients who often face lengthy delays for new medicines to reach the market.
The move, outlined by the Cabinet late on Sunday, seeks to address high medicine costs and access to healthcare for China’s population of nearly 1.4 billion. In the past five years, China has approved just over 100 innovative new drugs, about one-third the number in developed markets.
Accepting overseas clinical data will help global drugmakers at time of growing competition from Chinese rivals in the world’s second-biggest pharmaceuticals market as well as pressure from authorities which are anxious to rein in prices.
“Overall, China’s support for scientific innovation with drugs and medical devices is lacking, and the quality of products on the market still falls short of top international levels,” the draft proposals said.
“We must speed up the examination and approval of urgently needed drugs and medical devices.”
The Cabinet also said it would look to improve the protection of medical intellectual property and boost the number and quality of clinical trial testing centers in China. The proposals contained no timeline for implementation.
“We want to make our drug industry large-scale and strong, make it more competitive, and shift our long-term reliance on imports of new drugs,” Wu Zhen, deputy head of the China Food and Drug Administration, told a briefing on Monday.
“(Some drugs) have been used overseas for 6-7 years before making it to market in China,” Wu added.
China in March proposed ways to speed up approvals for imported drugs, including reforming clinical trial requirements. It also wants to boost its own drug industry and see a shift from generic drugs and towards more innovative medicines and medical equipment.

By Donn Marten -
Vice President Mike Pence was to have attended today’s National Football League game between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers but chose to leave after several players chose to use his presence to make an anti-American political statement.
CDN – http://www.conservativedailynews.com
The Colts were to have honored longtime player and future Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning during a ceremony but while the home team respected the flag by standing, the actions of the opposing San Francisco 49ers were seen as sufficiently disrespectful to the Veep that he departed the venue before kickoff.
As reported by Indianapolis Fox affiliate Fox 59 “VP Mike Pence leaves Colts game because 49ers players knelt during anthem”:
Vice President Mike Pence decided to leave the Indianapolis Colts game Sunday because some 49ers players knelt during the national anthem. In a tweet, the former Indiana governor said “I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.” Minutes after that tweet, his office released a full statement. “I left today’s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem. At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their courage, resolve, and resilience, now, more than ever, we should rally around our Flag and everything that unites us. While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem. I stand with President Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.” It was announced Friday that Pence would attend the game with the second lady. The game is special, because Peyton Manning’s jersey will be retired at halftime and he will be inducted into the Ring of Honor. Before the game, he tweeted that he was looking forward to honor “the great career of #18 Peyton Manning.” Pence’s actions will no doubt be seized on by those who have polluted the NFL with their racial grievances and hatred of President Trump as “proof” that he stands for white supremacy and Nazism but he was dead right to leave and many of the other fans in attendance should have done so as well instead of being subjected to the politics of radical leftist racial grievance mongers that have driven the league’s popularity to historic lows.
The Vice President expressed the following via Twitter:
52m Vice President Pence ✔@VP Replying to @VP While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem
Vice President Pence ✔@VP I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem. 11:08 AM – Oct 8, 2017
Pence was formerly the Governor of Indiana.
It’s just what the NFL needed too, even more negative publicity before the early games even kicked off.
